object oriented programming
objects has properties or behaviors

class: is a blueprint of an object
object: is an instance of a class 

there is no difference between objects and instances both are the same. 
itenary operator: 

class can have variables and methods

## Class library is a set of classes

every class writen in java have 2 components: attributes and behaviors

## attributes: defines the appearance of an object
    ex: class moto{
        color,
        style,
        make
    }
## instance variable defines the attribute of an object

## behavior: determine the way object will work
    ex: start engine

to define an object behavior we create methods which look and behave like functions in other language
Methods: are functions defined inside classes that operate on instances of those classes.


lets create a class

    class Motocycle{
        String make;
        String color;
        boolean engineState; // this will check if the engine is on or off.
    }
    // we will create a method to the class

    void startEngine(){
        if (engineState == true){
            System.out.println("The engine has started);
        }else{
            engineState = true;
            System.out.println("The Engine is now on. ");
        }
    }

### subclassing means to create a new class from some other class in the class hierarchy
### inheritance is the process of creating a new class from an existing class.

### super class is the parent class from which other classes are derived
### sub class is the child class that inherits from the parent class
